1. grouper.create(manifest)
extend this so manifest['id'] can be pre-populated.
If it can't honour the ID (eg taken or not uniquely completable)
then it raises.
If it is passed a manifest without an ID in it
then it will generate a new ID as it currently does.

2. grouper.joined(id)
extend this so if grouper.id?(id) is false then rather
than raising it simply returns nil.
This is a nice BatchedMethod optimization, eg
if you want to see if an old style kata-ID has
a single avatar.
